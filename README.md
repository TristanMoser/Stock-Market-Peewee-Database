# Stock-Market-Peewee-Database

As part of a research project into the volatility of stock market assets, I created an SQL database using the Peewee Python library. I also helped develop a web server to dynamically search the database. 

All Python files can be found in the WebInterface folder. Other folders contain sample data files.

Without going into the detail of what each file is gathering for the database, the files that create the SQL databases are as follows:

-- company_data.py
-- gc_data.py
-- gc_cross_mkt.py
-- shape_data.py

The web server is launched via the server.py file.
